# The Best Airline to Fly Based on Delay Statistics
## Cora Wagner

For this project, I selected a data set from The Bureau of Transportation on airline delays. I wanted to take a look at what airline is best to fly at BWI over the span of three years before the Covid-19 shutdown (2017-2019).

The data, as mentioned previously, was created by The Bureau of Transportation since they have access to flight data. Their website had a nice GUI for users to clean the data they would like to look at before they download an Excel sheet. It was here that I selected to have all airports and all airlines wihtin the 2017-2019 time period. Having a broad range of airports and airlines allowed to me reask questions as I was playing with the data in Tableau. In the end, I used Baltimore-Washington International (BWI) airport as the standard airport in my research since that is the airport that my fiance and I fly in and out of the most.

Once I decided the airport, I looked at the total number of delayed flights each airline had at BWI. I am making a correlation between number of flights and number of delays to determine that Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and Delta Airlines are the top three airlines at BWI. Meaning they are the airlines flown the most by travelers at BWI.
